#segmentation:
- will produce files that are roughly a tenth of the originating tif
- runs fine locally using ~ 500MB files
- can handle ~1.3GB file locally
- needs ~ 10x file size in RAM while processing (does not scale linearly for larger files)

- can't write .gpkg files to shared drive (but can write them to local just fine). can write .tif files to shared drive without issues. investigate


#tiling:
- tiling files applies LZW compression. ok?
